                            I am primarily interested in syntax and morphology from both a theoretical and a typological perspective. My interests within these areas are very diverse, but my research has focused on agreement in Mazahua (Oto-Manguean), ellipsis in Spanish, and clitic placement and clitic linearization in Serbocroatian.    <br>

							<b>Agreement in Mazahua</b><br>
                            I am currently quite interested in Split-S agreement systems, which (despite being present in a decent number of language families) has not received enough attention from formal approaches compared to other morphosyntactic alignments and split systems. <br>
							<br>
							In my first Generals Paper, I explored the Split-S agreement system in Mazahua (Oto-Manguean), a head-marking language where unergative (S<sub>A</sub>) and transitive subjects (A) cross-reference the same set of agreement affixes in the verb, which differs from the one that cross-references unaccusative subjects (S<sub>P</sub>) and objects (P). I argued that this split can be accounted for by making two generalizations about how (and how early) little-<i>v</i>s in Mazahua enter into an Agree relation with their internal arguments. Following the core idea of the Unaccusative Hypothesis (Perlmutter 1978; Burzio 1986), I argued that S<sub>P</sub> and P arguments (merged as complements of the lexical verb) agree with (and receive Case from) little-<i>v</i> <i>in situ</i>. On the other hand, A and S<sub>A</sub> subjects (merged higher in the structure) enter into an Agree relation with (and receive Case from) T —as argued for other languages (Chomsky 1981; Massam 1985; Sportiche 1988; Chomsky 1995, among others). You can acces the manuscript <a href="documents/gp1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. <br> 
							<br>
							Nowadays, I am trying to expand this analysis to include adjectival predicates, where subject (person) agreement is encoded through a different set of morphemes from the ones used in verbal predicates.<br>

                            <b>Stripping and Pseudostripping</b><br>
							Stripping and pseudostripping, two elliptical constructions where only a DP/PP remnant and a polarity particle survive deletion, have been treated as related structures and analyzed along the same lines. Nonetheless, despite being almost identical in their surface representation (differing only on the position of the polarity particle with respect to the remnant), these constructions show very different syntactic behaviour regarding binding and optionality of ellipsis. By looking at the kind of remnants that can survive stripping/pseudostripping, the anaphoric relations available in each construction and the differences regarding information structure, I was able to show that stripping and pseudostripping are in fact very different constructions. I have proposed that pseudostripping constructions involve conjunctions of two CPs, where the remnant in the second conjunct is dislocated in TopicP and TP is deleted. On the other hand, I argued that stripping structures do not actually involve any elliptical operation, but are analyzed as cases of constituent negation/affirmation, where the "remnant" is fronted to be focalized.<br>
							<br>
							<b>NP-Ellipsis</b><br>
							I am also interested in a phenomenon known as the <i>uno-strategy</i>, a mechanism that spells out the atypical exponents <i>uno</i> 'a', <i>alguno</i>  'some' and <i>ninguno</i>  'no' in NP-ellipsis (NPE) constructions instead of the usual forms of the determiner un and the quantifiers <i>algún</i>  and <i>ningún</i>, which are found in non-elliptical constructions. To account for this, I built on previous work on the <i>uno</i>  strategy (Bernstein 1993) and argued that the vowel /o/ that appears in NPE is the phonological exponent of the masculine Gender morpheme, which is not attached to determiners and quantifiers when the N-head of the DP is overtly realized, but it is merged as an Agreement node (Agr°) through nominal concord (Norris 2012, 2014) in elliptical contexts where Gender features would not be recoverable from the elided noun.<br>

						<b>Clitic linearization</b><br>
                            Most of the literature on Serbocroatian clitics has focused on accounting for the (2nd) position of the clitic string within a clause, but not on providing an explanation for the strict order in which different clitics appear with respect to each other. In my MA forum paper I argued that clitics in Serbocroatian are linearized inside a clitic string based on how feature-specified they are. This account relied on the morphological structure of the clitics and not on their phonological properties, as previous accounts had proposed. In addition to providing an explanation for the internal order of the clitic string, this proposal allowed accounting for exceptions to this order and for illegal sequences of clitics in this language.
